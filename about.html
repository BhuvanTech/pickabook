                <h2>What Are Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks?</h2>
                <p class="para1">A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a decentralized communication model between two peers
                    also known as nodes, which can communicate with each other without the need for a central server.
                    Unlike the seeder/leecher (or client/server) model in which a seeder makes the request and a leecher
                    fulfills the request,
                    the P2P network model allows each party to function as both a seeder and as a leecher. This means
                    that the network, once formed, can be used by the
                    participants to share and store files without the help of an intermediary. </p>
                <h2>How Do P2P Networks Work?</h2>
                <p class="para1">A peer-to-peer model is maintained by a distributed network of computers. This means
                    the computers don’t have a server or central administrator as each node holds a copy of the files —
                    acting as both a server and a client. Therefore, each node can upload files for other nodes or
                    download files from them. These nodes use their own hard drives to store their data instead of a
                    central server. </p>
                <p class="para1">Since each node has common capabilities to store, transmit and receive files, P2P
                    networks tend to be faster and more efficient. Unlike traditional architectures in which a single
                    point of failure exists, a P2P network has a distributed architecture which makes it extremely
                    resistant to cyberattacks. </p>
                <h2>Peer-to-peer (P2P) Use in Blockchain </h2>
                <p class="para1">The concept of blockchain was popularized in 2008, as part of the proposal for Bitcoin,
                    a virtual currency developed to address the age-old problem of trust. Bitcoin creator Satoshi
                    Nakamoto defined it as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” built with the aim to create a P2P
                    digital form of money without banks. </p>
                <p class="para1">The underlying blockchain technology leverages the power of P2P networks and provides a
                    shared and trusted ledger of transactions. As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain records
                    transactions as an immutable timestamped digital block that indicates senders and receivers. No
                    centralized authority manages the blockchain networks and only the participants can validate
                    transactions among each other. The technology allows people and institutions to trust the output
                    without trusting the participants. This new form of distributed data storage and management acts as
                    a digital ledger that publicly records all transactions and activities. </p>
                <h2>Where Does Blockchain Store the Transaction Data?</h2>
                <p class="para1">The data on a blockchain is structured much differently than a typical database. While
                    a database stores information into tables, a blockchain structures its data into blocks. These
                    blocks have a certain storage capacity to add each transaction taking place on the network. Once a
                    block is filled, a new block is added to the previously filled block to add new transactions,
                    thereby forming a chain of blocks called the blockchain.</p>

                <p class="para1"> As such, blockchains are decentralized and therefore are not stored in a central
                    place. Instead,
                    they are stored in nodes or computers that partake in the network. Each node has a copy of the
                    blockchain, or in other words, the transactions that are done on the network. Thus, the system is
                    backed up by every single node participating in the network.</p>
                <h2>Who Owns The Blockchain?</h2>
                <p class="para1">No one owns the technology, although certain and specific blockchains can be owned by
                    several entities. Although the technology is generally associated with Bitcoin, the idea behind
                    blockchain can be traced back to 1991 to the work of Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta. </p>
                <p class="para1">However, it doesn’t really matter who introduced blockchain technology, because it’s a
                    <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@genesishack/draft-what-are-blockchain-protocols-and-how-do-they-work-94815be5efa7  target="_blank">protocol</a>
                    . While you can claim the ownership of a blockchain application, you can’t technically own
                    the technology itself
                </p>
                <h2>What Is a P2P Crypto Exchange?</h2>
                <p class="para1">P2P crypto exchanges allow users to buy or sell directly with another user. Unlike
                    centralized exchanges where you have to complete
                    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-and-kyc/  target="_blank">KYC</a> to process an order, most P2P
                    exchanges allow
                    you to send/receive cryptocurrencies without asking you for identity verification. Also, exchanges
                    based on the P2P model have no single point of failure like centralized exchanges do.
                </p>
                <h2>How Do P2P Crypto Exchanges Work?</h2>
                <p class="para1">A user can usually register with the exchange without having to go through identity
                    verification. Registration simply requires an email address and a password. After registering, a
                    user can go through different buy and sell offers posted by individuals on the platform. Each offer
                    has different payment options, a different rate and usually a minimum or maximum purchase amount. A
                    buyer can select an offer and contact the seller to set up a transaction. If you’re a seller, you
                    can post the accepted payment method as well as any fee involved. Generally, P2P crypto exchanges
                    use an escrow account to deposit cryptocurrencies or other collateral from the users to ensure the
                    safety of the platform.</p>
